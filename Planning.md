- VS Code word wrap help (Alt+Z/Toggle Word Wrap).
- Refined prompt for Live Workout builder (Push/Pull/Legs; create/clone/edit/delete; sets/reps; Mongo-ready data).

- Repo context/structure review (frontend + Express/Mongo backend, API base config).
- Tools to inspect Mongo data (mongosh/Compass/VS Code extension) and connection steps.
- Live Workout UI redesign prompt (two-column layout, builder + exercise library, bold visual direction).
- Prompt to fix category dropdown/accordion opening all sections; per-category toggle state.

- Progressive overload push/pull workout suggestions for athletic performance.
- CLI-friendly formatted workout plan (Push/Pull/Legs table for cmd Codex).
