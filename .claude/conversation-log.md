# Conversation Log - WorkoutnMeal Project

## Session: 2025-11-23

### User
Asked about retrieving a previous conversation after renaming the directory.

Explained that I don't have access to previous conversations - each session starts fresh. Suggested checking `~/.claude/` directory or project-specific `.claude/` folder for any existing logs.

### User
Requested saving conversations going forward.

### Assistant
Created this conversation log file at `.claude/conversation-log.md`.

Explored the codebase and provided a comprehensive summary:
- **Tech Stack:** Vanilla TypeScript + HTML/CSS with browser LocalStorage
- **Features Complete:** Dashboard, Workout Tracker, Meal Plan, Weight Calendar, Navigation
- **Status:** Functionally complete, ready for personal use
- Suggested next steps: form validation, edit functionality, data export, charts

### User
