• Right now:

  - Frontend on GitHub Pages (kevzhg.github.io/Homebase) points to the Render API https://homebase-
    50dv.onrender.com/api (set in index.html when the host ends with github.io), which uses your Atlas DB.
  - Local dev (running npm start/npm run server) points to http://localhost:8000/api and thus your local
    MongoDB (because MONGODB_URI defaults to mongodb://localhost:27017 unless you override it).

  To switch:

  - Frontend: set window.API_BASE_URL to the URL you want before loading the app (e.g., in index.html);
    otherwise it falls back to localhost.
  - Backend: export MONGODB_URI/MONGODB_DB before npm run server to target a different DB (e.g., the Atlas URI
    for cloud).


    When you go to Live workout, for each type, push pull or leg, I want to be able to build custom
  workout by selecting from a list of excerises. You can use the excerises in there for now, and
  the current workout as a template. Then, you shuold be able to create new workout, clone any
  existing workout, delete workouts. Each workout I can build from a list of excersises, choose set and reps, then save the workout. then I shoould be able to clone this workout. Lets go with 3 main categories. Eventually I need to saved these works to my Mongo data base

  Add excerise type to each. Power, Hypertrophy, Compond, Fexlibility
  Cardio, Each workout should display each of these on the main card, and give it a rating of the overall workout type, for example it is power focused, or Hypertrophy focused.




  Be able to Highlight each excerise to mark it as keyt exceriSE,where then It will have a high yellow background and be starred. then for each workout and workout template, it shows number of key excercises


  push
  Bench press - Power
  Incline Bench press - Hypertrophy 4x8
  Shoulder press - Power 4x6
  Dips - Compond

  pull
  Pullups 4x6

  Also, 

  Add an audible beep when rest time ends: play a “beep beep beep … beep beep beep” pattern (6 beeps total) with a short pause between the two triplets.

Scope/files: live workout rest timer logic in `src/liveWorkout.ts` (and any needed audio helper). Do not affect other pages.

Behavior:
- When a rest timer completes, play 3 quick beeps, brief pause (~300–500ms), then 3 more quick beeps.
- Use Web Audio API (or a tiny inline audio buffer) so it works without external assets. Keep volume reasonable.
- Do not block the UI; allow overlapping timers to avoid stacking sounds (stop any current beep before starting a new one).
- Keep all existing rest timer start/stop/reset behavior unchanged.


Fix timer pause logic and track total vs active training time.

Scope/files: live workout timer logic in `src/liveWorkout.ts` (and related UI rendering). Do not touch other pages.

Requirements:
- Bug: when paused, the timer visually stops but paused time gets added back on resume. Fix so elapsed time does not advance while paused.
- Track two metrics per session:
  - Total elapsed: wall-clock from start to finish (including pauses).
  - Active training time: only unpaused time.
- Persist both in the active workout state (resume-safe).
- UI: show both metrics (e.g., near the timer). Format as mm:ss.
- On pause/resume:
  - Record pause start and accumulate paused duration to compute active time.
  - Resume should not retroactively add paused time to active time.
- Finish should show final total and active durations.
